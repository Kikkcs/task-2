1. Purpose of Urgent/Threatening Language
Phishing emails often use psychological pressure to push the recipient into quick action without thinking. This increases the chance of clicking links or opening attachments.

2. Examples from the New Year’s Bonus Email Body
“Submit your form before midnight to claim your bonus.”
“Failure to respond immediately may result in your bonus being forfeited.”
“This is your last chance to receive your end-of-year reward.”
“Immediate action required to secure your bonus.”

Analysis:
These phrases create urgency, making employees feel they must act quickly.
The implication of loss or penalty (“forfeited”) is threatening and increases stress.
Combined with a reward promise (bonus), this is a classic phishing tactic.

3. Why It’s Suspicious
Legitimate HR emails rarely threaten employees or impose immediate deadlines for bonuses.
The language is designed to bypass careful thinking and prompt impulsive actions.
If you feel rushed or anxious when reading the email, it’s a warning sign.

4. Key Takeaway
Any email using urgent deadlines, penalties, or immediate action requirements, especially in combination with financial rewards, should be treated as suspicious and verified through official channels.
