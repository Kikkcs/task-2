Analysis:
All three examples show the link text looks official, referencing the company or HR, but the real URLs point to external or lookalike domains.
Shortened URLs like bit.ly hide the real destination, making it impossible to tell at a glance where you are being redirected.
Domains with extra words or alternate TLDs (.info, .net) are not part of the official company domain.
