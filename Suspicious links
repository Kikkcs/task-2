1. Attachments

The email contains a malicious attachment, often named like:
Bonus_Structure_2025.xlsm
NewYearBonusForm.docx
YearEndBonus.pdf
Red flags for attachments:
Requests you to enable macros (.xlsm or .docm) — a common way to deliver malware.
Unexpected file type for the context (HR should never send Excel macros or unknown PDFs to request sensitive info).
Generic or vague file names that create urgency (“Submit to Claim Bonus”).

Guideline:
Never open attachments from unverified emails. Legitimate HR departments use secure internal portals for bonus forms.

2. Links in the Email
The email may contain links embedded in text or buttons, such as:
https://company-bonus-portal.info/claim
https://company.com.bonus-update.net
Click here to claim your bonus
Red flags for links:

Domain mismatch: The link domain is not the official company domain (company.com).
Lookalike domains: Extra words, hyphens, or alternate TLDs (.net, .info, .xyz).
URL shorteners: Using bit.ly, tinyurl.com, or similar to hide the real destination.
Unexpected login requests: Asking for corporate credentials, bank details, or personal information.

Guideline:
Hover over links to see the real URL without clicking.
Use online scanners like VirusTotal to safely check suspicious URLs.
