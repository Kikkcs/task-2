Here in the above sample phishing mail, there are several ways of analysing or identifying spoofing which are as follows below:-

1. Extract the Sender’s Email Address
In your email client, view the full sender details (not just the display name).

From: "HR Department" <hr@company-bonus.com>


2. Compare Domains

Compare the sender’s domain with your official company domain.

Official: hr@company.com

Spoofed: hr@company-bonus.com, hr@bonus-company.com, or hr@company.co

Even small differences like added words (-bonus, -secure), or a changed TLD (.net instead of .com) are signs of spoofing.


3. Check for Display Name Tricks

Attackers may use display names that hide the real address.
For example:     From: "HR Department - Company Pvt Ltd" <hr@bonus-update.com>

The display name looks authentic, but the actual domain (bonus-update.com) reveals it’s fake.


4. Examine Header Fields (Technical Check)

Open the email headers (in Gmail, “Show Original” → in Outlook, “View Message Source”).
Look for these fields:

From:
Return-Path:
Reply-To:
Received:
Authentication-Results:




Then check:  From vs Return-Path: If they are different, spoofing is likely.
Example:
      From: hr@company.com
      Return-Path: hr@bonusmail.net

→ Spoof detected.
Reply-To mismatch: Attackers might redirect replies to another address.
Reply-To: hr@claimbonus-mail.com
→ Suspicious.


5. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Verification

In headers, look for the Authentication-Results line:

         spf=fail
         dkim=fail
         dmarc=fail


If any of these fail, the sender is not authorized to send emails on behalf of that domain.

Example of spoofed message:

             Authentication-Results:
             spf=fail (sender IP is 192.0.2.123)
             dkim=fail (no valid signature)
             dmarc=fail (policy reject)

Legitimate emails should usually show spf=pass and dkim=pass.

6. Domain Registration Check

Search the sending domain (company-bonus.com) on a WHOIS lookup site (like whois.domaintools.com).

If it was:  Recently registered (within days or weeks),Owned by an unrelated person or registrar,  then it’s very likely spoofed.
