1. Spoofed Sender

The email appears to come from the HR department but uses a fake domain (hr@company-bonus.com).
Display name mimics the real HR department, but the actual address is not legitimate.

2.Header Discrepancies
Return-Path and Reply-To addresses do not match the From address.

3.SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication fail.
The email originates from an external IP unrelated to the company’s mail servers.

4.Suspicious Attachments
Attachment names such as Bonus_Structure_2025.xlsm or NewYearBonusForm.docx.

5.Files may contain macros or request sensitive information.
HR typically does not send bonus forms via email attachments.

6.Suspicious or Mismatched Links
Visible text suggests official company links, but actual URLs point to external or lookalike domains (company-bonus-portal.info, company.com.bonus-update.net).

7.Shortened links like bit.ly/bonus2025form hide the true destination.
Urgent or Threatening Language

8.Phrases like “Submit before midnight to claim your bonus” or “Failure to respond will forfeit your bonus.”
Creates psychological pressure to act quickly, bypassing careful scrutiny.

Personalization and Social Engineering
Includes employee first name, last name, and company name to appear legitimate.
Combines authority, reward, and urgency to increase click rates.

9.Timing and Context
Sent near year-end, exploiting the expectation of bonuses.
This timing makes recipients more likely to trust and act on the email.
